# mnist
Deep Learning with TensorFlow | Neural Networks A hands-on project demonstrating how deep learning models work using TensorFlow. Covers neural network basics, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics using Python.
# 🧠 Deep Learning with TensorFlow | MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates how **Deep Learning** works using **TensorFlow** and the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**.  
It walks through the process of loading data, building a neural network, training it to recognize digits, and evaluating model accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Load and preprocess the **MNIST** dataset directly from TensorFlow/Keras
- Build a simple **feedforward neural network**
- Train and evaluate model performance
- Visualize accuracy and loss curves
- Demonstrate the working of TensorFlow computation graphs

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy / Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
